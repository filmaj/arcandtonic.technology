# arctonic

this is an example app that uses the [arc.codes](https://arc.codes) serverless
framework together with the [tonic.technology](https://tonic.technology) js
frontend framework. it also blatantly steals the mjs loading approach from
[@kristoferjoseph](https://github.com/kristoferjoseph)'s
[arc-example-templates](github.com/kristoferjoseph/arc-example-templates)
project.

## requirements

- node.js

## getting started

    npm start

... then load the url it tells you.
